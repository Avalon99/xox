            Running just for running’s sake may not be enough reason for some people to take on a race event such as a marathon. You may look at the challenge and think: 'What’s the purpose of actually doing it other than just getting to the finish line?'. But raising valuable funds can be your very reason for running, although you’ll definitely derive some self-satisfaction from completing the race itself, too, especially if it's a challenging race distance.<br>

                  Charities with guaranteed places in races generally have to purchase their places from the race event that you are entering. But if you are lucky enough to have secured your own place through the race’s ballot or other entry system, opting to use your entry to run for a charity means that the charity will not incur any costs of that place. What you raise will be largely profit, with only a certain number of things, for example the general admin costs, having to be covered by the charity.

                  There may be a personal reason for you wanting to run for a charity, for example if you, a family member, or friend has been affected by a particular disease or illness. Running for a charity may help you feel like you’re doing your bit for the cause that is closest to your heart. It’s often the case that people are motivated by the memory of a loved one, and you might even be able to encourage one of your friends to run for the same charity.
